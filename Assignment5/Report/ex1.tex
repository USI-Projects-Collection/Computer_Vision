In the projective plane \( \mathbb{P}^2 \), a line is represented by a homogeneous vector \( (a, b, c)^T \), defining the equation \( ax + by + cz = 0 \), where \( (x, y, z)^T \) are the homogeneous coordinates of points on the line. The intersection of two lines is found using the cross product of their homogeneous vectors.

\subsection*{Step 1: Define the Line Equations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For line \( l = (2, 4, 8)^T \), the equation is:
    \[
    2x + 4y + 8z = 0
    \]
    \item For line \( m = (-2, 3, -1)^T \), the equation is:
    \[
    -2x + 3y - z = 0
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Compute the Cross Product}
The homogeneous coordinates of the intersection point are given by \( p = l \times m \). For vectors \( l = (l_1, l_2, l_3) = (2, 4, 8) \) and \( m = (m_1, m_2, m_3) = (-2, 3, -1) \), the components are:
\begin{align*}
    p_x &= l_2 m_3 - l_3 m_2 = 4 \cdot (-1) - 8 \cdot 3 = -4 - 24 = -28 \\
    p_y &= l_3 m_1 - l_1 m_3 = 8 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-1) = -16 - (-2) = -16 + 2 = -14 \\
    p_z &= l_1 m_2 - l_2 m_1 = 2 \cdot 3 - 4 \cdot (-2) = 6 - (-8) = 6 + 8 = 14
\end{align*}
Thus, the homogeneous coordinates are:
\[
p = (-28, -14, 14)^T
\]
Since homogeneous coordinates are defined up to scale, divide by 14:
\[
p = \left( \frac{-28}{14}, \frac{-14}{14}, \frac{14}{14} \right) = (-2, -1, 1)^T
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Convert to Cartesian Coordinates}
For a point \( (x, y, z)^T \) with \( z \neq 0 \), the Cartesian coordinates are \( (x/z, y/z) \). Here, \( z = 1 \), so:
\[
x = \frac{-2}{1} = -2, \quad y = \frac{-1}{1} = -1
\]
Thus, the Cartesian coordinates are \( (-2, -1) \).

\subsection*{Step 4: Verification}
Substitute \( (x, y, z) = (-2, -1, 1) \) into both equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Line \( l \): \( 2(-2) + 4(-1) + 8(1) = -4 - 4 + 8 = 0 \)
    \item Line \( m \): \( -2(-2) + 3(-1) - 1 = 4 - 3 - 1 = 0 \)
\end{itemize}
Both are satisfied, confirming the solution.

\subsection*{Final Answer}
The Cartesian coordinates of the intersection point are:
\[
\boxed{(-2, -1)}
\]
